# What is data structure

- data structure is a way to store and orginize data so that it can be used efficiently
- collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or
  operations that can be applied to data
- almost every application involves data that is modelled in a certain way
- data structures are needed to efficiently manage data
- data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time
  and memory, also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're
  already aware of
