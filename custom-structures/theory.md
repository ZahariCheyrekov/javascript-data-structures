# Stack

- stack is sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
- the last element inserted into stack is the first element to be removed
- stack is an abstracjt data type
- it is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
- stack data structure supports two main operaions:
  - push, wich adds an element to the collection
  - pop wich removes the most recently added element from the collection
- usage:
  - browser history tracking
  - undo operation when typing
  - expression converions
  - call stack in JavaScript runtime
