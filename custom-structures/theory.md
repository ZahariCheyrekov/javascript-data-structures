# Stack

- stack is sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
- the last element inserted into stack is the first element to be removed
- stack is an abstracjt data type
- it is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
- stack data structure supports two main operaions:
  - push, wich adds an element to the collection
  - pop wich removes the most recently added element from the collection
- usage:
  - browser history tracking
  - undo operation when typing
  - expression converions
  - call stack in JavaScript runtime

# Queue

- the queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO)
- queue is an abstract data type and it is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
- the queue data structure supports two main operations:
  - enqueue, wich adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
  - dequeue, wich removes an elemet from the front/head of the collection
- usage:
  - printers
  - CPU task scheduling
  - callback queue in JavaScript runtime
